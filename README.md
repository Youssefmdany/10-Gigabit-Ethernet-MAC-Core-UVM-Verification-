# 10 Gigabit Ethernet MAC Core UVM Verification 
### 10 Gigabit Ethernet, often abbreviated as 10GbE, is a telecommunications technology that provides data transmission speeds of up to 10 billion bits per second (10 Gbps). This speed isten times faster than the conventional Gigabit Ethernet standard.




### 10GbE is essential for high-speed connections in datacenters and enterprises, linking routers, 10G switches, andservers. It's perfect for long-distance, high-bandwidth trunks in Ethernet and fiber-based networks. Its applications span LANs, WANs, and MANs.




### The OSI and the MAC and PHY components in ethernet:
