# 10 Gigabit Ethernet MAC Core UVM Verification 
### 10 Gigabit Ethernet, often abbreviated as 10GbE, is a telecommunications technology that provides data transmission speeds of up to 10 billion bits per second (10 Gbps). This speed isten times faster than the conventional Gigabit Ethernet standard.




### 10GbE is essential for high-speed connections in datacenters and enterprises, linking routers, 10G switches, andservers. It's perfect for long-distance, high-bandwidth trunks in Ethernet and fiber-based networks. Its applications span LANs, WANs, and MANs.

10 Gigabit Ethernet MediaAccess Controller (MAC)
it’s a hardware component that is responsible for managing thecommunication between a network interface card (NIC) and thephysical Ethernet network at a data rate of 10 gigabits per second(Gbps).


10 Gigabit EthernetPhysical Layer (PHY)
The PHY layer is responsible for the physical signaling andtransmission of data over the physical medium. It interfaces withthe MAC layer above and the physical medium below, translatingdigital signals into analog signals for transmission and vice
